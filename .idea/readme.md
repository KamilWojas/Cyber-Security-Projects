# Cyber Security Projects

This repository provides simple tools and resources to support learning about cyber security. The focus is on practical scripts and documentation that can be expanded as new topics are explored.

## Structure

- `src/` – source code for small utilities and scripts.
- `docs/` – documentation and notes about the tools.

These initial utilities include a basic port scanner and helper functions that can be extended as the project grows.
